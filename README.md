## Weather Report Program

This Python program retrieves weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API and allows users to obtain temperature, wind speed, and pressure information for specific date and time intervals. The program uses the `requests` library to fetch hourly forecast data for London. Users can select their choice from the following options:

- **Get Temperature**: Retrieve the temperature in degrees Celsius for a specified date and time.
- **Get Wind Speed**: Obtain the wind speed in meters per second for a specified date and time.
- **Get Pressure**: Fetch the atmospheric pressure in hectopascals (hPa) for a specified date and time.
- **Exit**: Terminate the program.

The program provides accurate weather information based on user inputs and ensures a user-friendly experience. It demonstrates practical usage of API data retrieval and parsing techniques using Python.

To run the program, make sure you have the `requests` library installed. You can run the script and follow the prompts to explore weather data for different time intervals.
